# House Price Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning regression model to predict house prices using various property features.

## Dataset

The dataset includes multiple features related to houses such as size, location, number of rooms, and other amenities along with their corresponding sale prices.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**  
   Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis to understand feature relationships.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize features.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   Create or transform features to improve model accuracy.

4. **Model Training**  
   Train regression models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluate model performance using RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics.

6. **Visualization**  
   Visualize feature importance and predicted vs actual prices.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository  
```

git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/House-Price-Prediction.git](https://github.com/yourusername/House-Price-Prediction.git)

```

2. Install dependencies  
```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

3. Run the main script  
```

python house\_price\_prediction.py

```

## Results

The model achieved strong prediction accuracy, helping to estimate house prices based on key property features.
